# Uber Booking Data Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

This project analyzes Uber ride bookings in Delhi for the month of June 2025 using structured SQL queries and dynamic Power BI visualizations. It focuses on demand trends, revenue performance, customer satisfaction, and operational bottlenecks.



## Overview

A dataset of 50,000+ bookings was used to simulate realistic ride patterns across vehicle types, payment methods, time of day, and booking outcomes. SQL was used to extract business-critical insights, and Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard for executive-level reporting.


## Objectives

- Understand daily and weekly ride demand patterns  
- Identify the most used and most profitable vehicle types  
- Analyze booking success and cancellation reasons  
- Compare customer and driver experience ratings  
- Evaluate payment preferences and revenue distribution  
- Highlight top-performing customers and profitable routes  


## Key Highlights

- 70,000 total bookings from June 1–30, 2025  
- 62% of all bookings were successfully completed  
- 7% cancelled by customers, 18% cancelled by drivers, 13% incomplete rides  
- 43,399 successful rides generated ₹6.39 million in revenue  
- Prime SUV and Prime Sedan had the highest average booking values  
- eBike and Bike had the shortest average ride distances  
- Average driver rating: 4.21 | Average customer rating: 4.09  
- Cash and UPI together made up over 85% of all payments  
- Top 5 customers contributed ₹16,967+ in booking value  
- Most common driver-side cancellation: Personal & Car related issues  
- Most common customer-side cancellation: Driver asked to cancel  


## Tech Stack

- SQL (MySQL-style queries)  
- Power BI Desktop  
- GitHub for version control and project documentation  


## Power BI Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard includes several visualizations, but the following had the most impact:

### 1. Ride Volume Over Time  
Revealed peaks in bookings on weekends and match days, guiding surge pricing and driver allocation strategies.

### 2. Booking Status Breakdown  
Highlighted success vs. failure rates, enabling operational performance benchmarking.

### 3. Payment Preferences by Vehicle Type  
Provided insight into how customers of different vehicle categories prefer to pay.

### 4. Customer vs Driver Ratings  
Enabled a direct comparison of service quality perception and actual delivery across ride types.


## SQL Query Summary

A total of 15 SQL queries were used to generate business and operational insights, covering the following areas:

- Daily booking trends and volume breakdown  
- Average and total ride distances by vehicle type  
- Booking status distribution and cancellation patterns  
- Top customers by revenue contribution  
- Vehicle-wise and payment-wise revenue summaries  
- VTAT/CTAT analysis during peak vs. non-peak hours  
- Pickup-drop route combinations with high revenue potential  
- Comparison of customer and driver ratings per vehicle type  

Each query directly supported either an operational insight or a Power BI dashboard visual, making the analysis comprehensive and actionable.
